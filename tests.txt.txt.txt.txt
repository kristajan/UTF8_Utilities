people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, 
and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to

An example of Vietnamese text in UTF-8 encoding would be: "Ch??o m???ng b???n 
?????n v???i Vi???t Nam" which translates to "Welcome to Vietnam" and includes 
special Vietnamese characters like "??", "??", and "??" that can be properly 
displayed using UTF-8 encoding.  Key points about this example: Special characters:

Vietnamese language utilizes diacritics like "??", "??", "??", "??", "??", "??", 
and "??" which are all part of the UTF-8 character set. 

Korean characters (Hangul) are part of the Unicode standard, which is fully supported 
by UTF-8 encoding.  -Each Korean character in UTF-8 typically takes up 3 bytes, 
as they fall within the multi-byte range of the encoding.  Example breakdown:

"???" (an) = "EC 95 8C"  "???" (nyeong) = "EB 82 98"  "???" (ha) = "EC 95 80" 
"???" (se) = "EC 95 8C"  "???" (yo) = "EB 82 98"
