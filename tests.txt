In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

Examples of international text with special characters include: "cafÈ" (French with the "È" accent), "aÒo" (Spanish with the "Ò"), "Straﬂe" (German with the "‰"), "Á„" (Portuguese with the "Á"), "ˆ" (German with the "ˆ"), "‡" (Italian with the "‡"), "Ê" (Danish with the "Ê") - essentially any text containing diacritics like accents, umlauts, or other non-standard characters beyond the basic English alphabet. 
Further examples across different languages:
French: "Èclater" (with the acute accent on "e")
Spanish: "piÒata" (with the "Ò")
German: "Mˆhre" (with the umlaut on "o")
Portuguese: "maÁ„" (with the cedilla on "c")
Italian: "gi‡" (with the grave accent on "a")
Swedish: "Âka" (with the ring above "a")
Polish: "sc" (with the "s" with a comma above) 

called —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –∞–±–µ—Ç–∫–∞ (IPA: [ äkr…êÀàjin ≤s ≤k…ê …êÀàb…õtk…ê]; tr. ukrainska abetka), from the initial letters –∞ (tr. a) and –± (tr. b); –∞–ª—Ñ–∞–≤—ñ—Ç (tr. alfavit); or, archaically, –∞–∑–±—É–∫–∞

Here are some examples of Ukrainian words and phrases:
–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç: (pryvit) An informal greeting that means "hello" or "hi" 
–î–æ–±—Ä–æ —Ä–∞–Ω–∫—É: (dobroho ranku) A greeting that means "good morning"

An example of Vietnamese text in UTF-8 encoding would be: "Ch√†o m·ª´ng b·∫°n ƒë·∫øn v·ªõi Vi·ªát Nam" which translates to "Welcome to Vietnam" and includes special Vietnamese characters like "ƒÉ", "√™", and "∆∞" that can be properly displayed using UTF-8 encoding. 
Key points about this example:
Special characters:
Vietnamese language utilizes diacritics like "ƒÉ", "√¢", "√™", "√¥", "∆°", "∆∞", and "ƒë" which are all part of the UTF-8 character set. 

Korean characters (Hangul) are part of the Unicode standard, which is fully supported by UTF-8 encoding. 
Each Korean character in UTF-8 typically takes up 3 bytes, as they fall within the multi-byte range of the encoding. 
Example breakdown:
"Ïïà" (an) = "EC 95 8C" 
"ÎÖï" (nyeong) = "EB 82 98" 
"Ìïò" (ha) = "EC 95 80" 
"ÏÑ∏" (se) = "EC 95 8C" 
"Ïöî" (yo) = "EB 82 98"
