b'Key points about this example:\n'
b'Special characters:\n'
b'Vietnamese language utilizes diacritics like "\xc4\x83", "\xc3\xa2", "\xc3\xaa", "\xc3\xb4", "\xc6\xa1", "\xc6\xb0", and "\xc4\x91" which are all part of the UTF-8 character set. \n'

b'Korean characters (Hangul) are part of the Unicode standard, which is fully supported by UTF-8 encoding. \n'
b'\x16Each Korean character in UTF-8 typically takes up 3 bytes, as they fall within the multi-byte range of the encoding. \n'
